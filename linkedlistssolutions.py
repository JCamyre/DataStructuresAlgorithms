# Questions: Are they int for the values (could be used for solution)
# Brute force: Account for no linkedlist or only one node. If we can use space, obv just append values and check if cur.val in vals. 
# Manually sort? Check vals of cur node with next node. Save the head initial head val. Keep on sorting until loop doesn't break. Have an if statement for each loop that checks if cur.val > next.val. Break if not true.

# Second while loop: compare adjacent values. 
# This prob an O(n log n), j cause that what most sorting algorithms are. Better than O(n^2) for sure.
# Reverse linked list, and compare the two as you iterate through (THIS WON'T WORK)

# Very easy to remove nodes

# This means we don't have to do anything with relinking the nodes. So by "delete", we don't delete the exact node object, just copy the value and delete the node that we can delete.
# Delete = replace value and delete the next node. 

# Visualization: A -> B -> C -> D. A -> C -> C -> D. Delete original C node. A -> C -> D
# Just know: When deleting, don't have to necessarily delete exact object, can "delete" by copying value and deleting the original node with the copied value.

# "Note that this problem cannot be solved if the node to be deleted is the last node in the linked list. That's
# okay- your interviewer wants you to point that out, and to discuss how to handle this case. You could, for
# example, consider marking the node as dummy."
